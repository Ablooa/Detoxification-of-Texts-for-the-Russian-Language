The repository provides code for CondBERT model that was introduced by Dementieva et al. (2021) 
We repeat their experiment on smaller data.

There are two notebooks:

1. **detox-text.ipynb** is for building [CondBERT model](https://www.mdpi.com/2414-4088/5/9/54#B26-mti-05-00054) and making predictions

2. **toxicity_evaluation.ipynb** is for training BERT classifier and evaluating the model above
